  ### End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence, Because this was our second project where we  learn HTML, CSS and Advance JavaScript. If we have more time we can able to add more products.

### Limitations:
All pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.
